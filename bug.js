This bug occurs when using Expo's `Constants.deviceId` within a background task.  The `deviceId` might return `undefined` or a different value than expected, leading to unpredictable behavior. This is inconsistent with the behavior observed in the foreground, where the `deviceId` is usually correctly retrieved. This problem is particularly noticeable when performing tasks like sending data to a server or identifying users after app suspension.
